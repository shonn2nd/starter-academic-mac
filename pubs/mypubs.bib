	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the relations among teacher value beliefs, personal characteristics, and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) in both intervention and nonintervention settings. One-hundred and nine in-service teachers from elementary to high schools participate in this study. Our ﬁndings reveal that compared to personal characteristics, teacher value beliefs are the only variable that can signiﬁcantly predict TPACK across both settings. In addition, in the non-intervention setting, the relations between personal characteristics and TPACK are also moderated by teacher value beliefs. How to foster teacher value beliefs around technology integration is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Research has focused on the significance of social presence in online learning. However, peer interaction does not always result in positive emotions and feelings; it can trigger tension, distress, and anger within a learning community. Therefore, conflictual presence, as a carrier of negative valence within presence, is also a critical element when it becomes inimical to online discussions. Drawing upon the socially situated identity theory and using discourse analysis, this study presents an authentic case where conflictual presence, social presence, and identity negotiation were intertwined throughout the entire life of an online learning community. Findings reveal that students craft their discourses to fashion themselves as a certain kind of facilitator and participant. Implicit and explicit identity negotiation is ubiquitous in discursive interactions and can lead to tension and conflictual socio-relations at times.},

	abstract = {In this study, researchers designed and implemented a 1-year professional development (PD) program that focused on supporting teachers in evaluating and selecting digital learning contents. Participants in this investigation included 109 teachers who consented to the study amongst a total of 171 teachers from ﬁve school districts across central Ohio. In addition to their participation in the PD program, they completed surveys, interviews, and self-reﬂections in this mixed-method study. The results revealed that teachers’ perceived TPACK increased over time throughout the PD program, suggesting that training teachers to evaluate digital contents can be an effective PD model to improve teachers’ capacity in learning technology integration. The PD program was especially effective for teachers with less prior experience in technology integration or related training. Mathematics teachers, in comparison to teachers from other disciplines, began with low TPACK; however, these initial differences gradually diminished over the course of the PD program. In terms of their motivation in digital content evaluation, teachers’ expectancy for success increased signiﬁcantly while their task values remained medium high. The qualitative analyses provided additional insights and revealed design suggestions for success in future PDs.},

Qualitative thematic analysis followed by quantitative K-means cluster analysis identiﬁed and validated four levels of teacher competency in DCE: familiarization, utilization, integration, and reorientation. In addition, this study also proposed design guidelines to scaffold DCE competency development tailored to the needs of teachers at various competency levels.},

Ability beliefs strongly predict expectancy and value beliefs. Most importantly, expectancy beliefs and value beliefs play differential roles in relation to teachers’ technology use in classrooms.

	abstract = {While the United States federal government and the main teacher education accreditation organization push for the inclusion of technology in teacher education across the curriculum, little attention has been paid to understanding the technology competencies and behaviors of teacher educators. This study explores this gap by investigating what direct and mediating factors predict technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in teacher educators, and how these factors along with TPACK influence the adoption of the ISTE technology standards in teacher education. The findings from a sample of 806 teacher educators across the United States indicate that there are significant differences in both TPACK and ISTE standard alignment across subject areas, and that experience levels positively predict ISTE standard alignment to a small degree. More significant, however, is the finding that technology knowledge and institutional support are important mediators, predicting TPACK and ISTE standard alignment. Additionally, TPACK strongly predicts ISTE standard alignment. These findings suggest that institutions should provide targeted support to teacher educators across disciplines and should adopt coherent technology frameworks for their programs.},

	abstract = {National policy and litigation have been a catalyst in many states for expanding personal outcomes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and have served as an impetus for change in state IDD systems. Although several metrics are used to examine personal outcomes, the National Core Indicators (NCI) In-Person Survey (IPS) is one tool that provides an annual depiction of the lives of people who receive Medicaid Home and Community Based IDD waiver services (HCBS). This article examines whether a validated, three-factor (Privacy Rights, Everyday Choice, and Community Participation) measure of Personal Opportunity, derived from NCI items, functions as predicted across nonequivalent, NCI cohorts (N ¼ 2400) from Virginia in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Multiple-groups confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed to examine the invariance and generalizability of the Personal Opportunity constructs. Results indicated that Privacy Rights, Everyday Choice, and Community Participation measured the same concepts even when time and group varied. Significant improvements in Privacy Rights and Community Participation were observed when comparing latent factor means across years. Findings provide stakeholders with a tool for interpreting personal outcomes in the contexts of policy and practice intended to improve inclusion and quality of life for adults with IDD.},

The sample includes two hundred and five in-service teachers from 121 schools in Taiwan. Using the latent moderated structural equations approach, this study finds that there is a synergistic interaction between competence beliefs and traditional pedagogical beliefs. The negative effect of traditional pedagogical beliefs on technology integration is amplified when competence beliefs is at an extremely low level. On the contrary, the maladaptive nature of traditional pedagogical beliefs is neutralized when the level of competence beliefs increases. Value beliefs in terms of perceived interest and usefulness significantly predicted technology integration. However, when controlling for the effects of these beliefs, constructivist pedagogical beliefs and perceived cost are not significant predictors. These findings revealed that the additive effect model commonly seen in the literature is short of capturing the complexity of teacher beliefs about technology integration. Stakeholders are suggested to devote their resources to foster competence and value beliefs about technology integration instead of pedagogical beliefs.},

The results showed that the changes in highschool students’ motivation were more complex than an increase or a decrease in the level of motivation. Students moved from having 1 set of motivational characteristics to another set of motivational characteristics across 2 academic years. School belongingness and prior achievement level were positively associated to motivation shifting toward more adaptive characteristics. Understanding the patterns and predictive factors of motivational change can better inform teachers and school administers to generate strategies that support students’ motivation development as a whole, shifting to increasingly adaptive motivational profiles over time. As there are few longitudinal person-centered studies of motivation situated in high school settings, the current study adds to practical knowledge about the mechanism of students’ motivation development at this crucial juncture in their academic career.},

Conscientiousness was also an important predictor of academic procrastination. Perceived instructor engagement and peer interaction did not predict academic procrastination.
