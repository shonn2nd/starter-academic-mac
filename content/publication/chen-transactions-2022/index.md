abstract: 'This study aimed to further the understanding of transactional relationships
  that exist between problem behaviors and academic performance in early childhood.
  Early academic and behavior difﬁculties increase the risk of school disengagement,
  academic failure, and dropout. Although children’s academic and behavioral difﬁculties
  have been shown to be intercorrelated, little research has focused on how the relationship
  reciprocates and progresses in early childhood. This study investigated how problem
  behaviors (i.e., externalizing and internalizing) inﬂuence and are inﬂuenced by
  academic performance (i.e., poor reading and math) from kindergarten to third grade.
  Participants included 18,135 students (51.22% boys) derived from a nationally representative
  sample in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2011 (ECLS-K:
  2011). Teacher ratings of children’s internalizing (low self-esteem, anxiety, loneliness,
  or sadness) and externalizing (ﬁghting, arguing, showing anger, impulsively acting,
  and disruptive behaviors) problem behaviors, as well as direct assessments of children’s
  academic performance (reading and math), were collected yearly. Cross-lagged panel
  modeling (CLPM) was employed to examine reciprocal relationships between problem
  behaviors and academic performance over time from kindergarten to third grade. The
  results supported the transactional relationships in early childhood, with higher
  externalizing as well as internalizing problem behaviors predicting lower academic
  performance and lower academic performance predicting higher externalizing and internalizing
  problem behaviors. The implications for research, prevention, and early intervention
  regarding the progression of academic and behavioral problems are discussed.'
