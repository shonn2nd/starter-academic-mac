abstract: In this study, researchers designed and implemented a 1-year professional
  development (PD) program that focused on supporting teachers in evaluating and selecting
  digital learning contents. Participants in this investigation included 109 teachers
  who consented to the study amongst a total of 171 teachers from ﬁve school districts
  across central Ohio. In addition to their participation in the PD program, they
  completed surveys, interviews, and self-reﬂections in this mixed-method study. The
  results revealed that teachers’ perceived TPACK increased over time throughout the
  PD program, suggesting that training teachers to evaluate digital contents can be
  an effective PD model to improve teachers’ capacity in learning technology integration.
  The PD program was especially effective for teachers with less prior experience
  in technology integration or related training. Mathematics teachers, in comparison
  to teachers from other disciplines, began with low TPACK; however, these initial
  differences gradually diminished over the course of the PD program. In terms of
  their motivation in digital content evaluation, teachers’ expectancy for success
  increased signiﬁcantly while their task values remained medium high. The qualitative
  analyses provided additional insights and revealed design suggestions for success
  in future PDs.
