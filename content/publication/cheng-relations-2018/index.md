abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the relations among teacher value
  beliefs, personal characteristics, and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge
  (TPACK) in both intervention and nonintervention settings. One-hundred and nine
  in-service teachers from elementary to high schools participate in this study. Our
  ﬁndings reveal that compared to personal characteristics, teacher value beliefs
  are the only variable that can signiﬁcantly predict TPACK across both settings.
  In addition, in the non-intervention setting, the relations between personal characteristics
  and TPACK are also moderated by teacher value beliefs. How to foster teacher value
  beliefs around technology integration is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
