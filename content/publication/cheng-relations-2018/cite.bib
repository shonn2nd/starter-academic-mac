 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the relations among teacher value beliefs, personal characteristics, and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) in both intervention and nonintervention settings. One-hundred and nine in-service teachers from elementary to high schools participate in this study. Our ﬁndings reveal that compared to personal characteristics, teacher value beliefs are the only variable that can signiﬁcantly predict TPACK across both settings. In addition, in the non-intervention setting, the relations between personal characteristics and TPACK are also moderated by teacher value beliefs. How to foster teacher value beliefs around technology integration is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
