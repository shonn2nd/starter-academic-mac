abstract: The study identified 6 groups of high-school students who possess unique
  motivational characteristics, ranging from amotivated to externally regulated, balanced
  demotivated, moderately motivated, balanced motivated, and autonomously motivated.
  The results showed that the changes in highschool students’ motivation were more
  complex than an increase or a decrease in the level of motivation. Students moved
  from having 1 set of motivational characteristics to another set of motivational
  characteristics across 2 academic years. School belongingness and prior achievement
  level were positively associated to motivation shifting toward more adaptive characteristics.
  Understanding the patterns and predictive factors of motivational change can better
  inform teachers and school administers to generate strategies that support students’
  motivation development as a whole, shifting to increasingly adaptive motivational
  profiles over time. As there are few longitudinal person-centered studies of motivation
  situated in high school settings, the current study adds to practical knowledge
  about the mechanism of students’ motivation development at this crucial juncture
  in their academic career.
