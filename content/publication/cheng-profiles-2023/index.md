abstract: 'The goal of this study was to identify achievement emotion profiles and
  environmental barriers vocational college students encountered in online learning
  environments. The individual antecedents and outcomes of achievement emotion profiles
  were also examined. Latent profile analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Blends
  of Negative Emotions, Nonemotional, and Pure Positive Emotion. Multinomial logistic
  regression showed tha­ texpectancies for online learning significantly predicted
  the increased likelihood of membership into the profile characterized by Pure Positive
  Emotion. The Pure Positive Emotion profile was associated with better time management
  and motivational regulation and lower academic procrastination. Text mining analysis
  of quali­ tative data showed that the major environmental barriers students in the
  Blends of Negative Emotions and Nonemotional profiles faced were related to instructor
  immediacy, peer interaction, help-seeking, and technical difficulties.'
