abstract: While the United States federal government and the main teacher education
  accreditation organization push for the inclusion of technology in teacher education
  across the curriculum, little attention has been paid to understanding the technology
  competencies and behaviors of teacher educators. This study explores this gap by
  investigating what direct and mediating factors predict technological pedagogical
  content knowledge (TPACK) in teacher educators, and how these factors along with
  TPACK influence the adoption of the ISTE technology standards in teacher education.
  The findings from a sample of 806 teacher educators across the United States indicate
  that there are significant differences in both TPACK and ISTE standard alignment
  across subject areas, and that experience levels positively predict ISTE standard
  alignment to a small degree. More significant, however, is the finding that technology
  knowledge and institutional support are important mediators, predicting TPACK and
  ISTE standard alignment. Additionally, TPACK strongly predicts ISTE standard alignment.
  These findings suggest that institutions should provide targeted support to teacher
  educators across disciplines and should adopt coherent technology frameworks for
  their programs.
