abstract: This study examined changes in teachers’ perceptions of external barriers,
  internal barriers, and their integration of digital educational resources across
  two years through variable-centered and person-centered approaches. Participants
  included 301 in-service middle and high school teachers from 18 schools in the United
  States. The results of variable-centered approaches showed some significant changes
  in external barriers and teacher behavior but not in internal barriers. However,
  person-centered approaches revealed that perceived changes in external barriers
  significantly predicted nuanced changes in the patterns of teachers’ educational
  digital resource integration and their beliefs about technology. As teachers perceived
  a stronger technology vision and commitment to professional development in their
  school environments, their personal practices and beliefs shifted together.
