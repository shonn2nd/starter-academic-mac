abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine why college students procrastinated
  in online courses from a selfregulated learning perspective. A sample of 207 college
  students participated in this study. Using path modeling, the results showed that
  students’ perceived content relevance and technology usability indirectly predicted
  academic procrastination through the roles of task value and emotional cost. Conscientiousness
  was also an important predictor of academic procrastination. Perceived instructor
  engagement and peer interaction did not predict academic procrastination. These
  findings revealed that academic procrastination in online courses was a complex
  phenomenon and stemmed from the interrelationships between college students’ per­
  ceptions of learning context, personal characteristics, and motivational beliefs.
  Practical implications for addressing academic procrastination in online courses
  are discussed in this paper.
