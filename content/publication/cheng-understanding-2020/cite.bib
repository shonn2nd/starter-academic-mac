 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between teachers’ ability beliefs, expectancy beliefs, value beliefs, and technology integration based upon expectancy-value theory of motivation. The results of conﬁrmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling show that teachers’ value and competence beliefs about technology integration are multidimensional constructs. Ability beliefs strongly predict expectancy and value beliefs. Most importantly, expectancy beliefs and value beliefs play differential roles in relation to teachers’ technology use in classrooms. The ways in which different aspects of teacher beliefs can be fostered are discussed.},
