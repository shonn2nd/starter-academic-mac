 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine how pre-service teachers’ competence beliefs, value beliefs, pedagogical beliefs, and their intention to integrate technology were related to one another. The sample was composed of 137 pre-service teachers from 22 schools in Taiwan. Using path modeling, the current study found that there was an interaction between competence and pedagogical beliefs. The relations between pedagogical beliefs and teachers’ intention to integrate technology were only significant when competence beliefs were low. These findings highlight the interdependent nature of teacher beliefs and suggest that pedagogical beliefs are not necessarily an internal barrier for teachers’ technology integration as long as competence beliefs are high.},
