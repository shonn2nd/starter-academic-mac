abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine how pre-service teachers’ competence
  beliefs, value beliefs, pedagogical beliefs, and their intention to integrate technology
  were related to one another. The sample was composed of 137 pre-service teachers
  from 22 schools in Taiwan. Using path modeling, the current study found that there
  was an interaction between competence and pedagogical beliefs. The relations between
  pedagogical beliefs and teachers’ intention to integrate technology were only significant
  when competence beliefs were low. These findings highlight the interdependent nature
  of teacher beliefs and suggest that pedagogical beliefs are not necessarily an internal
  barrier for teachers’ technology integration as long as competence beliefs are high.
