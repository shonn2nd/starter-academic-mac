abstract: Research has focused on the significance of social presence in online learning.
  However, peer interaction does not always result in positive emotions and feelings;
  it can trigger tension, distress, and anger within a learning community. Therefore,
  conflictual presence, as a carrier of negative valence within presence, is also
  a critical element when it becomes inimical to online discussions. Drawing upon
  the socially situated identity theory and using discourse analysis, this study presents
  an authentic case where conflictual presence, social presence, and identity negotiation
  were intertwined throughout the entire life of an online learning community. Findings
  reveal that students craft their discourses to fashion themselves as a certain kind
  of facilitator and participant. Implicit and explicit identity negotiation is ubiquitous
  in discursive interactions and can lead to tension and conflictual socio-relations
  at times.
