abstract: This study examined the relationship among motivation, engagement, and academic
  performance through a person-centered research approach. Participants included 10,527
  students in grades 9 to 12 from twenty public high schools across the state of Ohio
  in the United States. Latent profile analysis revealed seven profiles of academic
  motivation including the amotivated, externally regulated, balanced demotivated,
  moderately motivated, identified/externally regulated, balanced motivated, and autonomously
  motivated profile groups. Students in these motivational profiles exhibited differences
  in cognitive and social engagement, as well as academic performance. In addition,
  multiple-group path analysis revealed different patterns of relationship among cognitive
  engagement, social engagement, and GPA, suggesting that motivational profile membership
  moderated the relationship between engagement and academic performance.
