abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between competence
  beliefs, value beliefs, pedagogical beliefs and teachers’ technology integration.
  The sample includes two hundred and five in-service teachers from 121 schools in
  Taiwan. Using the latent moderated structural equations approach, this study finds
  that there is a synergistic interaction between competence beliefs and traditional
  pedagogical beliefs. The negative effect of traditional pedagogical beliefs on technology
  integration is amplified when competence beliefs is at an extremely low level. On
  the contrary, the maladaptive nature of traditional pedagogical beliefs is neutralized
  when the level of competence beliefs increases. Value beliefs in terms of perceived
  interest and usefulness significantly predicted technology integration. However,
  when controlling for the effects of these beliefs, constructivist pedagogical beliefs
  and perceived cost are not significant predictors. These findings revealed that
  the additive effect model commonly seen in the literature is short of capturing
  the complexity of teacher beliefs about technology integration. Stakeholders are
  suggested to devote their resources to foster competence and value beliefs about
  technology integration instead of pedagogical beliefs.
