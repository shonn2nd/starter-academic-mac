 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between competence beliefs, value beliefs, pedagogical beliefs and teachers’ technology integration. The sample includes two hundred and five in-service teachers from 121 schools in Taiwan. Using the latent moderated structural equations approach, this study finds that there is a synergistic interaction between competence beliefs and traditional pedagogical beliefs. The negative effect of traditional pedagogical beliefs on technology integration is amplified when competence beliefs is at an extremely low level. On the contrary, the maladaptive nature of traditional pedagogical beliefs is neutralized when the level of competence beliefs increases. Value beliefs in terms of perceived interest and usefulness significantly predicted technology integration. However, when controlling for the effects of these beliefs, constructivist pedagogical beliefs and perceived cost are not significant predictors. These findings revealed that the additive effect model commonly seen in the literature is short of capturing the complexity of teacher beliefs about technology integration. Stakeholders are suggested to devote their resources to foster competence and value beliefs about technology integration instead of pedagogical beliefs.},
