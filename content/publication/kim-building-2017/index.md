abstract: "The purpose of the current study is to investigate teachers' digital content\
  \ evaluation (DCE) competency as a combined set of teachers' intellectual ability\
  \ and affect-motivation in evaluating digital content. To this end, this study employed\
  \ an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to examine 102 inservice teachers’\
  \ experiences in a one-year DCE professional development program. Qualitative thematic\
  \ analysis followed by quantitative K-means cluster analysis identiﬁed and validated\
  \ four levels of teacher competency in DCE: familiarization, utilization, integration,\
  \ and reorientation. In addition, this study also proposed design guidelines to\
  \ scaffold DCE competency development tailored to the needs of teachers at various\
  \ competency levels."
