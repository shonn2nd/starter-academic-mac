 abstract = {The purpose of the current study is to investigate teachers' digital content evaluation (DCE) competency as a combined set of teachers' intellectual ability and affect-motivation in evaluating digital content. To this end, this study employed an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to examine 102 inservice teachers’ experiences in a one-year DCE professional development program. Qualitative thematic analysis followed by quantitative K-means cluster analysis identiﬁed and validated four levels of teacher competency in DCE: familiarization, utilization, integration, and reorientation. In addition, this study also proposed design guidelines to scaffold DCE competency development tailored to the needs of teachers at various competency levels.},
